API

Here’s a summary of the API structure for your Laravel backend:

All API endpoints are under the /api/v1 base path.
The main API routes are defined in v1.php.
Endpoints cover authentication, judgments, attachments, publications, bookmarks, and search.
Example endpoints:
GET /api/v1/me — Get user info
POST /api/v1/auth/device/authenticate — Device authentication
GET /api/v1/judgment/{uuid} — Get judgment by UUID
GET /api/v1/publication/{uuid} — Get publication by UUID
GET /api/v1/bookmark/tags/all — Get all bookmark tags
GET /api/v1/search/parametric/options/{type}/{query} — Search options
All endpoints are protected by authentication middleware. The actual base URL depends on your environment configuration (see APP_URL in .env or app.php).
